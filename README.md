# Idea and development

Memes are fragments of cultural information that are quickly transmitted with our help.
Each iteration of a meme retains the meaning of its predecessor and seeks to perpetuate itself over time.

In Memética these concepts are used as components in puzzle solving and as a form of progression that modifies the world.
Using memes the player will be able to raise bridges that allow him to connect different areas.
Each new area connects with the previous ones, making the puzzles more and more complex.

# Implementation

The puzzles are composed of 3 elements: Paintings, orbs and pedestals.

The puzzles are solved by looking at the paintings and placing on the pedestal the orb that contains similar memes.
Some pedestals only allow areas to be unlocked if the correct orb is placed.

The difficulty of the game is based on the fact that the unlocked areas enlarge the puzzle, forcing the player to look for orbs left in previous areas and plan their movements.
